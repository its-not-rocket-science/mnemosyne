Imagine an ancient Greek column where the fluting subtly transforms into branching neural pathways.

At the top of the column is a stylized 'M' that resembles interconnected graph nodes.

Font: Classical serif with slight modern simplification.
Colors: Soft marble white + dark graphite + electric blue for neural links.
