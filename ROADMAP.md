## Category 1 — Release hardening

These are blockers or near-blockers before the system is safe to run against real data.
See `BETA_GAP_REPORT.md` for the detailed blocker breakdown by alpha / beta / vision tier.

- **Replace `create_all` with `alembic upgrade head`** on fresh startup. `create_all` silently diverges from migration history. (*partial → implemented*) — **Private alpha blocker A1**
- **`max_chars` guard on `/parse` and `/ingest`** — long texts block the event loop. Configurable, default 10 000 characters. Return 413 above the limit. — **Private alpha blocker A2**
- **Data export endpoint** — `GET /users/me/export` returns all knowledge state as JSON. — **Private alpha blocker A4**
- **JWT authentication** — `POST /auth/register` + `POST /auth/login`; replace header-only identity in `get_current_user`. — **Public beta blocker B1**
- **Login/register UI** — frontend login panel, JWT in `sessionStorage`, logout. — **Public beta blocker B2**
- **WCAG 2.1 AA audit** — keyboard-only run through the full parse → lesson → review flow; screen-reader smoke test with NVDA and VoiceOver. — **Public beta blocker B3**
- **CORS lockdown** — warn-on-`*` is already in `main.py`; wire it to a deployment checklist. — **Public beta blocker B5**
- **Rate limiting** — ~~per-IP and per-user rate limiting on the parse endpoint at minimum.~~ **done**: `slowapi` limiter; JWT > X-User-Id > IP key function; configurable `RATE_LIMIT_PARSE`; tests in `test_rate_limit.py`. — ~~**Public beta blocker B6**~~
- **Privacy policy + data deletion** — ~~`DELETE /users/me` removes all user data; visible privacy policy page.~~ **done**: `DELETE /users/me` cascades all user rows; `frontend/privacy.html`; "Delete account" button in header with confirmation; privacy link in footer. — ~~**Public beta blocker B7**~~
- **Error monitoring** — ~~Sentry SDK or equivalent before public traffic.~~ **done**: `sentry_sdk` initialised in `main.py` when `SENTRY_DSN` env var is set; `sentry_environment` defaults to `development` / `production` from `DEBUG`. — ~~**Public beta blocker B8**~~
- **Structured request logging** — ~~add `request_id` to each request's log lines for trace correlation.~~ **done**: `RequestIdFilter` injects `request_id` (8-char hex UUID) into every log line via context var; middleware sets `request.state.request_id`. — ~~**done**~~
- **Background DB persist** — ~~currently `_persist_parse` runs in the request path after the response is built. Move to a true background task so the client is not held waiting on DB I/O.~~ **done**: `BackgroundTasks.add_task(_persist_parse_background, ...)` after response is built; factory injected so tests can override. — ~~**done**~~
- **< 2 s parse time for 500 words** — profile `es_core_news_sm` on the target hardware; document the result.

## Category 2 — Multilingual foundations

These unlock meaningful expansion beyond Spanish.

- **Full French plugin** — ~~replace the regex stub with `fr_core_news_md`~~ **done**: `fr_core_news_sm`, vocabulary + conjugation + agreement. — ~~**Private alpha blocker A3, Public beta blocker B9**~~
- **Full German plugin** — ~~`de_core_news_sm`~~ **done**: `de_core_news_sm`, vocabulary + conjugation + `case_agreement`; separable verbs; canonical_form conventions documented.
- **Full Russian plugin** — **done**: `ru_core_news_sm`, full morphology with aspect system, 6-case agreement, past-tense gender-based conjugation.
- **Full Japanese plugin** — **done**: `ja_core_news_sm` + SudachiPy, vocabulary with hiragana readings, katakana→hiragana conversion.
- **Modal RTL fix** — ~~apply `dir`/`lang` to example text and drill prompts~~ **done**: `#applyTargetLang` covers title, example text, drill prompts/text/input; `<bdi>` isolation in fill-blank and multiple-choice feedback. CSS uses logical properties throughout. — ~~**Public beta blocker B4**~~
- **RTL CSS audit** — **done**: `[dir="rtl"]` text-alignment; logical margin/padding/size properties throughout modal; close button stays at inline-end independent of content direction.
- **Non-Latin script round-trip tests** — **done**: 43 tests covering Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Russian, Japanese through `canonical_object_id`, SQLite insert, retrieve, and lossless assertion. API-level RTL pipeline tests included.
- **`canonical_form` conventions for non-Latin morphology** — **done**: `PLUGIN_AUTHOR_GUIDE.md` documents `case_agreement`, Russian/Japanese patterns, and a new "Agglutinative Languages" section covering Finnish (15-case nominal + conjugation) and Turkish (tense/aspect/mood/person/number/voice) canonical form schemes with axis-order rules and lesson-builder compatibility notes.
- **Lesson generator pluggable templates** — ~~`build_lesson()` produces English prose regardless of target language.~~ **done**: `LanguageCapabilities.tense_pool` / `mood_pool` let each plugin declare language-appropriate MC drill options; `LessonContext` carries them through to `_build_conjugation`; mood MC drill wired up (was defined but not emitted). Spanish/French/German pools set. — ~~**planned**~~
- **`ENABLED_LANGUAGES` documentation** — ~~explain how to run a single-language deployment and how to add a new language to an existing database without affecting other users' data.~~ **done**: `.env.example` documents the variable with inline notes; CONTRIBUTING.md has "Single-language deployments" and "Adding a language to an existing deployment" sections. — ~~**planned**~~
- **Plugin loading resilience** — ~~a plugin that raises during `create_plugin()` is already skipped with a `WARNING`. Add a `GET /ready` signal that reports degraded-plugin status so operators can see partial failures.~~ **done**: `PluginRegistry._failed` records failures; `GET /ready` includes a `plugins` field (`"ok"` or `{"degraded": [...]}`) and returns 503 when any plugin failed to load. — ~~**planned**~~

## Category 3 — Vision-complete / long-horizon work

These follow from the starting vision but require category 1 and 2 to be solid first.

- **User accounts** — multi-user data isolation is complete (all routes scoped to `current_user`; `UserLanguagePreferenceRow` implemented). Remaining work: JWT auth middleware, login/register API routes, login UI. See category 1.
- **Review event log** — a `review_events` table (one row per review: user_id, object_id, quality, mastery_score_before/after, reviewed_at) unlocks retention curves, exact time-to-mastery, per-session analytics, and FSRS parameter fitting. The current `user_knowledge` table stores only the current FSRS state. This is pure DB + route work; the scheduler does not change.
- **Real dictionary integration** — gloss data, example sentences, etymology. The `lesson_data` JSON field accepts any keys; the lesson generator needs a source to populate them.
- **Real translation integration** — one-tap translation of extracted objects. Requires a clear policy on attribution and API cost.
- **FSRS parameter fitting** — per-user or per-deck parameter optimisation improves retention predictions by ~5 pp. Requires the review event log.
- **PWA / offline mode** — service worker, IndexedDB lesson cache, offline reviews with sync-on-reconnect.
- **Background processing for large texts** — async job queue (e.g. Redis Streams or Celery) for corpora > 10 000 characters; progress SSE to the frontend.
- **Dead and historic language support** — annotation mode (dictionary lookup, no morphological parser) rather than pretending spaCy-style NLP is available. Latin, Classical Arabic, Koine Greek as first candidates.
- **Idiom and multiword-expression detection** — `idiom` and `nuance` types exist in the schema but no plugin extracts them yet.
- **Mobile / PWA** — responsive layout audit at 320 px; touch targets already meet WCAG 2.5.8.

## Quality targets (ongoing)

- [ ] `alembic upgrade head` is the only DB initialisation path (no `create_all` in production)
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA on the core parse → review flow
- [ ] 90% branch coverage on `backend/srs/` and `backend/parsing/`
- [ ] Parse time < 2 s for 500 words on the CI runner
- [ ] Zero `# type: ignore` comments without an explanatory note
